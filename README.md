# FullStack_Website_For_Movie

Welcome to my Full Stack Movie Streaming Web Application built with React (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend). This project simulates a real-world OTT platform, providing features like user authentication, subscription management, dynamic movie listings, "Add to Wishlist", and profile-based experiences. React ensures a smooth and responsive user interface, while Spring Boot powers the backend with efficient REST APIs and secure data handling.

The goal of this project is to combine modern frontend design with robust backend functionality, creating a seamless and scalable movie streaming experience. Whether youâ€™re here to explore full-stack architecture, practice component-based UI development, or understand backend integration using Java, this repository demonstrates it all in a clean, modular, and industry-standard approach.
